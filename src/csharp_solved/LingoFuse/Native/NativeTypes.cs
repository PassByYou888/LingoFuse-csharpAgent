// ============================================================================
// NativeTypes — opaque handles and callback prototypes for the C ABI.
// ============================================================================
//
// This file declares the managed representation of:
//
//   - the two opaque handle kinds exposed by the native library;
//   - the three callback delegate prototypes the C ABI expects.
//
// All five types are declared internal. User code never sees them:
// DataHandle and AppHandle wrap the raw pointer, and the callbacks are
// registered through the managed signatures on AppHandle and
// NetworkEvents. Exposing these types publicly would invite user code
// to hand-roll P/Invoke calls, which is exactly what the layer-1
// boundary exists to prevent.
//
// HANDLE TYPES
// ------------
// Both DataHnd and AppHnd wrap a single IntPtr. The wrapper exists for
// type safety and null semantics. The wrapped pointer must NEVER be
// dereferenced directly; all access goes through the exported functions
// in NativeMethods.
//
// CALLBACK TYPES
// --------------
// All three delegates are declared with CallingConvention.Cdecl. The
// managed default conventions (fastcall on x64, stdcall on x86) would
// misalign the stack on Windows and crash the process.
//
// All three delegates execute on a native worker thread. Their bodies
// must never call any blocking LingoFuse function (LF_Call,
// LF_LocalCall, LF_PrepareDone, LF_Shutdown); doing so deadlocks.
//
